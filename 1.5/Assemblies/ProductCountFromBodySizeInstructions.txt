This extension causes the products of a RecipeDef to be multiplied by the body size of the ingredient (or average size if there are multiple corpses). This should be added to the RecipeDef itself, just above the ending </RecipeDef> tag if the recipe isn't already using modExtensions.

For the most basic function, you only need to point to the class. This will multiply all products, which may not be ideal for some things (regardless of the size of an animal, there's usually only one skull to take, one heart to extract, etc.). If you want all products to be multiplied by body size, add this to the end of the RecipeDef:

  <modExtensions>
    <li Class="ProductCountFromBodySize.ProductByBodySize" />
  </modExtensions>




If there are some that you don't want multiplied, you can add a list of indexes that the code will skip. These indexes are 1 based, so if you want to skip the top item in your products list, you use <li>1</li>. If you want the second item gone, <li>2</li>. These lis belong in a indexesToSkip tag within the mod extension like so:


  <modExtensions>
    <li Class="ProductCountFromBodySize.ProductByBodySize">
      <indexesToSkip>
        <li>2</li>
      </indexesToSkip>
    </li>
  </modExtensions>
